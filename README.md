Medication tracker gives an interface for you to save the medication you're currently taking, the expected reaction. The perceived reaction. The date you started taking it (it should tell you how much time you've been taking it based on the current date). Side effects. Dependency. and other useful things for your doctor that you usually forget when get to see them.
